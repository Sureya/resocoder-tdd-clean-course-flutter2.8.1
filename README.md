# Introduction

This repo is implementation of `Learn Flutter Clean Architecture & TDD - Full Course (Flutter Tutorial)` course from [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc3B_mMrZ-Q&t=13996s)


## Why is this repository required ?

While the structure of the course is exactly the same, the original course was created a 
while ago, and some parts of it is bit outdated. The things that are different in this repository are


- Written in Flutter 2.8.1, Hence with `Null Safety`
- Uses `internet_connection_checker: ^0.0.1+3` to check for internet connection
- Uses `mocktail: ^0.2.0` for testing
- Uses `bloc_test: ^9.0.2` for testing blocs
- Uses `dio: ^4.0.4` for HTTP calls
- Uses `riverpod: ^1.0.3` for state management.
